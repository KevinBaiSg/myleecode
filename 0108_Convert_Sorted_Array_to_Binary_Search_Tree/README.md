108. Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree
Easy

Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

Example:

```text
Given the sorted array: [-10,-3,0,5,9],

One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:

      0
     / \
   -3   9
   /   /
 -10  5
```

### 解决方法
#### solution1
思路：因为左右节点高度差一，所以可以反向的中序遍历思维来填充二叉树
